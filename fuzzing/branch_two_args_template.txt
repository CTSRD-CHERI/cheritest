# Test for conditional branches taking two arguments. Tests different
# offsets covering the whole 16-bit range as well as various argument
# values and branch types. The test is centered around the instruction
# labelled 'branch', which targets the one labelled 'target' (except
# for some small offsets). Padding is added before or after the branch
# to acheive the correct spacing. s0-s5 are used to keep track of the
# path taken.
