# XXX: our test code saves the CP0 config register in self.MIPS.s1 so that
# we can determine how this test should behave.  Our test cases don't
# currently check that, so may return undesired failures.  The third check
# below should be conditioned on (DC > 0) || (SC == 1) -- i.e., a cache is
# present, which might cause it not to incorrectly fire for gxemul.
