# Exercise cache instructions
#
# Execute a series of cache instructions that are found in the kernel.  We
# currently don't check if they are correct, but merely check that they don't
# lock up the processor.  Since we have a write-through L1 cache, the only 
# function of the cache instructions is to synchronize L1 instruction and data
# caches.  We don't currently support cache instructions to the L2.
